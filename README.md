# coviddeaths
A Jupyter Notebook where I create several visualizations based on data about COVID-19 deaths from 2020 to 2024.  I analyzed data related to California by year, sex, and age, as well as covid vs. non-covid related deaths.

The data comes from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/provisional-covid-19-death-counts-by-sex-age-and-state/resource/5617aad1-02ba-4dc7-8491-efb6bdec62a7
